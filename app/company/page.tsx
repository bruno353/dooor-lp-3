                Dooor was born at the intersection of two vastly different worlds: the demanding, high-stakes environment of heavy industry and the fast-paced, cutting-edge innovation of decentralized technology.

              <p className="text-lg font-extralight text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our CEO, Thiago Castroneves, spent over a decade designing, negotiating, and implementing complex, mission-critical solutions for the global steel industry. This experience forged a deep understanding of the real-world challenges faced by large enterprises: where security, reliability, and operational integrity are paramount. Transitioning to the world of Web3, he reviewed over 700 projects, searching for technologies with the potential to solve problems at an institutional grade.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg font-extralight text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The breakthrough came with project #725 and its founder, Bruno Laureano. Bruno, a pioneering young engineer, had developed an award-winning AI agent, but faced the classic enterprise adoption problem: companies would not risk their sensitive intellectual property with an outside provider. In response, he engineered an elegant solution: a decentralized orchestration and compute layer that allowed his AI to run in a trustlessly private and secure "space."
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg font-extralight text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Thiago saw the immense, untapped potential. Bruno had solved the privacy issue for a single use case; together, they realized his architecture could become the bridge for the entire AI ecosystem. It could be a new standard, a secure layer allowing the world's most innovative open-source models to be used by the world's most demanding enterprises with absolute privacy and IP protection.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg font-extralight text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                This was the opening for <strong className="text-white">Dooor.</strong> The triple 'O' a manifesto for a new, unconventional way of enabling collaboration.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg font-extralight text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                But one critical question remained. If the AI operates in total privacy, how can its outputs be trusted? What prevents malicious or flawed information? The answer led to our final architectural layer and our core identity: Zero-Knowledge Proofs. By adding the power of cryptographic verification, we evolved from a private AI platform to the world's first OS for <strong className="text-white">Verifiable AI</strong>.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-lg font-extralight text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                Today, our multi-layered architecture is complete: a one-of-a-kind mesh that makes it possible to trust the outputs of AI, not by seeing the data, but by seeing the proof.
